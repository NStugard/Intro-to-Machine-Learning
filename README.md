# Intro-to-Machine-Learning

About the project: The dataset of about 5574 rows and 2 columns being used in the project was forked from a github repository. 
The dataset consist of spam dataset and the project involves the use of supervised machine learning model (Naive Bayes Models i.e (GausianNB, BernouliNB, MultinomialNB) and KNN Model).
The above task is to be carried out using classification Models, which helps to predict incoming emails on a device to be either Spam or not.
